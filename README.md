# tacoma_crime_map

Custom created icons.  I am trying to make an app that looks better than data.seattle.gov. crime map.  They broke my demonstration app like 3 times over the years and they finally killed it with an update in which they removed the gps geo location data from the api.  I will switch over to my hometown of TACOMA data api and I will make a baller ass app.
